        <li class="description-block">
            Through in-depth user research including conducting interviews, constructing personas and journey-mapping we
            identified several core problems that may exclude specific user groups from accessing gardening as a hobby.
            The core problems were identified to fall into categories assocaited with dexterity, mobility, strength and
            precision. The evergarden tool aims to help elevate some of these problems to help make gardening more
            inclusive to new users and those who have disconnected from their hobbies.

        <li class="description-block">
            Through the prototyping process we gained a variety of skills including working with electronics (Ardiuno
            nano, servo motors, magnetic connectors etc.), learning rapid additive manufacturing techniques such as 3D
            printing and optimising the process for this to create fast, stable and high quality prints. Experiments and
            testing with soil and dirt were also performed to ensure the tooling would work in the desired environment.

        <li class="description-block">
            Our product was designed for easy disassembly and repair to help increase it's lifespan.
            Evergarden exists in a harsh environment, which includes exposure to moisture, dirt and other ogranic
            materials, which can pose potential threats to internal electronics and components, seals were incorporated
            into the casing design to mitigate this risk. Another major component of the design was intricately designed
            ribs to ensure the electronics were fixed and secure in their correct positions.

            An important element of the design was an extension tube aimed to alleviate the lower back pain associated
            with leaning down for long periods of time when gardening by increasing the overall length of the tool.
            This was a technical challenge as we had to ensure power could still be provided to the motor sutuated at
            the lower half of the device whilst maintaining overall device alignment and effective sealing from the
            environment.
            The solution involved the use of both magnetic electrical connectors to ensure electrical connections and
            larger button magnets to ensure a strong connection between the tubing.
