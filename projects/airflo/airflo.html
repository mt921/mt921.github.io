            Airflo is a B2B concept that aims to tackle the issue of PM2.5 particulates on the London Underground in the
            form of a sustainable advertising product. This solution is a cross-track structure which draws in air when
            trains pull into the station, the air is then passed through several filters to remove a range of
            particulate sizes. As a potential incentive for advertisers and TFL, the filtering structure is capable of
            showing advertisements.

            Airflo has roots in sustainability and public health, therefore throughout its development process we aimed
            to select materials with minimal environmental and further health impacts. We had discussions with
            specialists from several sectors including from Imperial College's Future Materials Group. Through research
            and discussions we were able to identify and validate bacterial cellulose as a potential high efficiency
            filter.
            This material is possible to be printed upon, which offers a means of advertising.

        <li class="description-block">
            Our original design featured a back plate with structures to help channel air through the filter.
            The process involved modelling the system and performing CFD analysis to view flow trajectories.

            Airflo was initially developed in the span of a weekend for Imperial College Design Engineering Society's
            2022 Cities of Tomorrow Makeathon.
