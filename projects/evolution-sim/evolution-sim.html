            In this 8 week project I constructed a web-based simulation model to test how creatures or 'agents' would
            behave under different conditions.
            The overall aim of this project was to initialise a set of randomly generated agents that would eventually
            converge to distinct behaviours in order to navigate different environments and maximise rewards.

            This allows the agent's brain structure to be updated.

            Neurons can be assigned as inputs or outputs, where outputs will trigger agents to perform an action (e.g.
            move, rotate etc.) and inputs will allow the agent to take in information about the environment.

        <li class="description-block">
            In order to prove useful behaviours were possible, several pre-programmed case studies were created.
            In these simple simulations agents can only rotate or speed up and the only information they can access is
            either their position, speed, direction or distance from other agents or simulation boundaries.

            The agents in the previous simulations all have the same pre-defined structures. The next challenge is to

        <li class="description-block">
            The simulation is adpated to follow a tournament architecture where agents are randomly generated, allowed

        <li class="description-block">
            The DNA structures of the most successful agents can be extracted, mutated and used to create new agents in
            the
            next tournament run. This process draws on the ideas of genetic algorithms and can be used to eventually
            train agents to aquire the behaviours shown above.

            The overarching goal of this project is to initialise a set of randomly generated agents that eventually
            achieve useful or interesting behaviours without manual input. In order to achieve this a continuous
            simulation architecture was created where agents are free to move about, consume smaller 'prey' agents in
            the
            system, clone themselves or grow. This allows for multiple generations to progress without user input.
