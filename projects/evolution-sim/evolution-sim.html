            This is a snippet of some of my work from summer 2023 during Imperial College's Undergraduate Research

            In this 8 week project I constructed a web-based simulation model to test how creatures or 'agents' would
            behave under different conditions.
            The overall aim of this project was to initialise a set of randomly generated agents that would eventually
            converge to distinct behaviours in order to navigatedifferent environments and maximise rewards.

            In order to prove useful behaviours were possible, several case studies of useful behaviour were defined.
            In these simple simulations agents can only rotate or speed up and the only information they can access is
            either their position, speed, direction or distance from other agents or simulation boundaries.

            The agents in the previous simulations all have the same pre-defined structures, however the next challenge
            is to be

        <li class="description-block">
            In order to tackle this challenge a tournament simulation architecture is defined where agents are randomly
            generated, the system is allowed to progress for a set number of timesteps and then agents are evaluated.

            The DNA structures of most successful agents can be extracted, mutated and used to create new agents in the
            next tournament run. This process draws on the ideas of genetic algorithms and can be used to eventually
            train agents to aquire the behaviours shown above.
