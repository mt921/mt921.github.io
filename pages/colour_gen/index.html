    <header><h1>Colour Generation Tools</h1></header>
    As an artist, designer or developer, working with colour is important.
    I had used online colour generation tools before such as
    <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">Adobe's Colour Generator</a>
    however I wanted to develop my own tools, to have more control over the outcome & understanding for how they work.
    <h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
    <h3><a href="./gen_app/">Try out current prototype!</a></h3>
    This simple interface allows users to generate colour schemes based on RGB inputs & random integer generation.
    The varibaility in the colour schemes can also be controlled. 
    <h3>Snapshots</h3>

    <figcaption>This was also one of my first explorations of responsive web design, where the interface
        works effectively at different window sizes.

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Exploration of different colour spaces: RGB, CMYK, HSB & Hexadecimal</li>
        <li>Designing different input methods: eyedropper tooling, colour wheel</li>
        <li>Experimenting with different methods of random generation</li>
        <li>Implementing concepts from colour theory to create a smarter colour generation tool
            e.g. generation of different types of colour scheme: monochromatic, analogous, complementary, triadic etc.
        </li>
    </ol>
