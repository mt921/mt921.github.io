    <header><h1>Colour Generation Tools</h1></header>
    As an artist, designer or developer, working with colour is important.
    I had used online colour generation tools before such as
    <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">Adobe's Colour Generator</a>
    however I wanted to develop my own tools, to have more control over the outcome & understanding for how they work.
