    <h1>CHIP - The Card Dealing Robot</h1>
    This is a group project in collaboration with 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhea-park221/">Rhea Park</a>
    which involves developing our skills in CAD, electronics, rapid manufacturing techniques and physical prototyping.
    The concept is CHIP, a card dealing robot which can help support the gameplay for Poker, BlackJack & UNO by rotating
    to face the required players and then either dealing a card face up or face down.
    <h2>CAD modelling</h2>
    The initial CAD model for the base components was created in Fusion360.
    This setup includes all of the mechanical parts required for rotation of the body.

    <h2>Physical Prototyping</h2>
    Our initial physical prototype included all of the CAD parts with the addition of an arduino Mega a motor driver chip 
    & several supports. The prototype successfully showed that CHIP could turn to face any user that wanted a card:

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    This project is currently a work in progress, our next steps are detailed below:
    <ol>
        <li>Develop refined electronics schematics to streamline prototyping process</li>
        <li>Redesign supporting structures to make pin access easier</li>
        <li>Develop the mechanical structure for a card flipping mechanism</li>
        <li>Implementing an interactive OLED display</li>
        <li>Finalise assembly with supporting walls & design features</li>
    </ol>
