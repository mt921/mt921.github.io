    & learning about tools such as Ramda.

    Current online Scrabble web applications were researched for inspiration.
    Simple wireframe sketches were created to plan out the general layout.
    The aim was to create a simple user interface with only the required components.

    <p>
        Several iterations for the user interface were developed using Figma. 
        The main aims were to make the UI as simple & clear as possible
        by using strong shapes & high contrast.
