    <h1>Recreating Scrabble</h1>
    This project involved designing the UI/UX, front-end implementation & back-end functionality 
    for the board game Scrabble which includes working with the functional programming paradigm 
    & learning about tools such as Ramda. 
    <h2>Initial Wireframe Sketching</h2>
    <img src="./images/wireframes2.png" alt="tag" width="100%">
    Current online Scrabble web applications were researched for inspiration.
    Simple wireframe sketches were created to plan out the general layout.
    The aim was to create a simple user interface with only the required components.
    <h2>UI/UX development</h2>
    <img src="./images/graphic.png" alt="tag" width="100%">
    <p>
        Several iterations for the user interface were developed using Figma. 
        The main aims were to make the UI as simple & clear as possible
        by using strong shapes & high contrast. 
    </p>
    <h2>Front-end build</h2>
    You can view the initial front-end build here, however currently it is only in a static state.
    <h2>Gameplay & Function Implementation</h2>
    This project is currently a work in progress. You can view a video of my 
    <a href="https://marcitalbot21.myportfolio.com/scrabble">initial test</a>
    which was created for my 2022 Computing 2 Coursework and shows several of the gameplay functions in operation.
    However the entire web-app is currently being redesigned and these functions need to be re-implemented.
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finalising grid generation methods</li>
        <li>Setting up user interactions for the front-end</li>
        <li>Linking initial functions from the game module to the front-end </li>
        <li>Refining functions to optimise efficiency & logical flow</li>
        <li>Improving word identifcation methods</li>
        <li>Implementing an "ai" component to allow users to play against the computer</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Currently in Progress</h2>
